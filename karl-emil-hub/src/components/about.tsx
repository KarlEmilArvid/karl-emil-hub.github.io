            <p>
                I'm doing my 2nd year at this Front-end course and this portfolio is to showcase things that I've
                made
                in my career, things I've learnt and small tidbits about me and what I do.
            </p>
            <p>and a paragraph explaining why i've made this portfolio and what i'm about</p>
            <p>maybe some text about how i'm studying and looking for internships</p>
        </article>
